title: Week 7 - Remote

# Git

Monday we did some review of Git. I think most of the stuff we covered were things that I've done before (like branches, forks, merges, etc). However, something I learned new was Rebasing. Both rebasing and merging are designed to integrate changes from one branch into another branch. A explanatory image best explains the difference: ![Merge vs Rebase](../images/rebase.png)
So we see the difference between merge and rebase now, but when would we use each? Something someone should note is that merge will keep/perserver history whereas rebase overwrites it. Thus, using rebase, one can remove undesired commits, or combine two commits in a single commit. What this means in the end is that it is much easier to handle the conflicts of rebase (as they come in one at a time whereas merge come all at once), but it also means reverting a rebase is much more difficult than reverting a merge. 

# Remote

So President Hamilton has officially announced we'll be remote in the forseeable future. Does this make me happy? Yes. It means my spring break at home will now be extended for a few weeks. Of course, there are obvious drawbacks. We saw on Wednesday class that the remote classes are quite complicated. While in theory it should be more easy to communicate in a team, as all we have to do is hop on our laptops, technical difficulties can lead to many more delays. Although, I won't go into the pros and cons of being remote (I'll leave that for another blog), I can say that it's a definite transition and will take a period of time getting used to it. Here's to the hopeful future!

# Team Projet

So I am in a group with Eva Ding and Emmett Hannigan. From our brief conversation (truncated b/c technical errors), Eva and I have similar background in terms of programming languages, while Emmett has a stronger Python language background. I'm hopeful for our small group and hope we get some good contributions throughout the semester. I think we've narrowed it down to Gatsby.js. For those who don't know what Gatsby is: "Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps". You can find an evaluation about it [here](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s20/project-evaluation/blob/master/gatsby_evaluation.md). I'm looking forward to work with my group members on this interesting project, especially now with this new remote class setup
