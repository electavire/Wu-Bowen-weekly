# Git

Monday we did some review of Git. I think most of the stuff we covered were things that I've done before (like branches, forks, merges, etc). However, something I learned new was Rebasing. Both rebasing and merging are designed to integrate changes from one branch into another branch. A explanatory image best explains the difference: ![Merge vs Rebase](../images/rebase.png)
