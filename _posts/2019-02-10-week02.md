For our browser extension, we've decided to create an application that will change certain words into images. So, if we were to have a line of text, we can click the extension and an image will popup instead of the text. As of now, we've decided on some SVG images that we want to be included; note that they must be SVG's as we want scalable images depending on the size of the text. 
I've tried to create a local version of the extension; however, as of now I haven't been able create a correct version (according to our plans) of it cause I have to learn more JavaScript. Whether or not we will have a working product by the due date will be dependant on whether I can figure out the code. One source that I am using to learn is [here](https://www.labnol.org/code/20056-convert-text-to-images-with-javascript) where it gives some tips to change from text to PNG elements. However, the issue is trying to get this working on a browser extension.
